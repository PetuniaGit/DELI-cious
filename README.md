This application is an interactive console-based system for managing sandwich orders. Users can create new orders, add items such as sandwiches, drinks, and chips, and customize their sandwiches by selecting the size, type of bread, meats, cheeses, toppings, and sauces. The application allows for additional requests, like extra meat or cheese and whether to toast the sandwich. After completing the selection, users can review their order details, including the total cost, and confirm the order, which generates and saves a receipt. The purpose of this application is to streamline the process of creating and managing customized sandwich orders efficiently.

This toString() method effectively uses the StringBuilder class to construct a detailed string representation of a sandwich order. It concatenates attributes like size, bread type, meats, cheeses, toppings, sauces, and whether the sandwich is toasted. By iterating through arrays of meats and cheeses, and joining lists of toppings and sauces, it dynamically builds a comprehensive description. This approach enhances readability and performance by minimizing intermediate string creation.
